We receive summarized chat sessions between our chat agents and our customers in JSON format (see the attached sample file). The exercise is to create two files from this dataset using Apache Spark and Scala (python can be used as well if you want):
- An "interactions" file: this contains chat session level data. 
The columns are: sessionID, CustomerID, client, OS, Browser, deviceType, resolved, escalated, geo, startTimeStamp, endTimeStamp
  Notes:
  - sessionID will come from the transcripts array.
- A "transcripts" file: this contains the actual chat lines. The columns are: sessionID, content, timestamp, senderName, lineNumber. 
  Notes:
  - Only include the lines from agent and customer (basically, senderName="agent" or "customer")
  - The lineNumber field needs to be computed - will serially increase starting 1, but will count only the agent and customer lines. Essentially, filter out lines from system.
